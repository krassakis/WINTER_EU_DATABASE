# WINTER_EU_DATABASE
This project has received funding from the Research Fund for Coal and Steel (RFCS) under GRANT AGREEMENT No.101057228  

The developed geodatabase is located online available at https://github.com/krassakis/WINTER_EU_DATABASE.git). Specifically, the database (Table 1) includes both spatial (e.g., regional boundaries, Land Cover types, mining areaâ€™s boundaries etc.) and non-spatial information (e.g., texts, photos, diagrams). Particularly, the texts and photos that have been collected and processed are part of the material for the narrative story-telling maps that will be delivered upon the end of the project. This material has been utilized for developing narrative stories for the Western Macedonia region, the Konin region and the Ruhr area on the ArcGIS Online platform. All the non-spatial information that was used in the story-telling maps has been visualised and converted into PDF format and is accessible online in the aforementioned folder.

GEODATABASE DESCRIPTION 
Regarding the geospatial dataset, 6 geodatabases (Figure. 1) of 50 feature classes, were created for the subtasks 3.2.1 and 3.2.2. Specifically, four geodatabases were created for stubtask 2.3.1 divided into the tree regions and the geographical boundaries. Furthermore, two geodatabases were created for the subtask 2.3.2 divided by regions.
